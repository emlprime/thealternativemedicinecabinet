Dr. Gruver makes it abundantly clear that our minds have a lot of power in our lives. As the saying goes, \u201cyou are what you eat,\u201d we are reminded in this book that we are what we think too.\r\n\r\nThe author has a sensible writing style, easy to read, understand and easy to follow ideas and solutions, most of which I would say are preventative measures. When I sat down to look at this book I was taken in right away and ended up reading the whole thing in one sitting.\r\n\r\nThis is a great book and guide for someone who wants to learn how to take charge of their own health in a natural way, ways to boost our immunity and how to empower ourselves to be an active participant in our own medical/health lives. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and I will surely be referring to it again and again.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}}, {"pk": 11, "model": "content.review", "fields": {"date": "2010-08-15", "source": "The Greenists", "description": "This book was really good...It's a great book to give to your Western doctor to enlighten them about other remedies for cancer, high blood pressure, or indigestion.\r\n"}}, {"pk": 12, "model": "content.review", "fields": {"date": "2010-08-15", "source": "www.everbeautiful.com ", "description": "If you\u2019re just learning about Alternative Medicine or are seeking a quickie review of the subject, Gruver\u2019s book will give you enough to swallow and digest.
