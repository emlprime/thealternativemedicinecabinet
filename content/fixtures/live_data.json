When I sat down to look at this book I was taken in right away and ended up reading the whole thing in one sitting.\r\n\r\nThis is a great book and guide for someone who wants to learn how to take charge of their own health in a natural way, ways to boost our immunity and how to empower ourselves to be an active participant in our own medical/health lives.

Great lively, veryinformative presentation! \r\n\r\nThe three discussed the connection between body, mind and spirit to help us uncover things about ourselves thatwe might not have thought about before. There were periods of silence and harmony, exercises that stretched and strengthened our bodies and lively information sharing. Great and stimulating moderation, too. Kathy not only shared so much, but kept everything alive, helpful and fun."
