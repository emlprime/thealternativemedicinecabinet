<p>Get ready to be inspired and entertained. Dr. Kathy Gruver delivers life-changing information in a fun and down-to-earth manner. She is an award-winning author, health practitioner, PhD, hip-hop dancer and trapeze artist. She is the host of the new national TV series, <i>The Alternative Medicine Cabinet</i>. But, her natural health career started, unknowingly, at the young age of 6 when she would massage her dad's neck on long car trips. Years later watching him care for her dying mother sparked even more interest in alternative medicine, life options and helping others heal. With a background in theatre and bad fast food, Dr. Gruver overcame her addiction to caffeine, artificial sweetener and meals that were eaten in the car. Now, decades after her mother died of cancer and 15 years since her last drink of soda, Kathy, with her 'Go for it'  attitude, makes it a point to help others navigate the sometimes-confusing world of nutrition, stress reduction, natural health and mind/body medicine.</p>
