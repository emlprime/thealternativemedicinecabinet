<h4><a href="/site_media/pdfs/speaker_one_sheet.pdf">Speaker One Sheet</a></h4>

<p>My natural health career started, unknowingly, at the young age of 6 when I would massage my dad's neck on long car trips and read his college biology text book for fun. Years later watching him care for my dying mother sparked even more interest in alternative medicine and helping others heal. With a background in theatre and bad fast food, I overcame my addiction to caffeine, artificial sweeteners and meals that were eaten in the car. Now, 24 years after my mother died of cancer and 10 since my last drink of soda, I make it a point to help others navigate the sometimes confusing world of nutrition, natural health and mind/body medicine. With people remarking that I look 10 years younger than I am, I combine moderation, exercise, strong will and common sense to proudly say that I am &quot;youthing.&quot;</p>

<p>I earned my Doctorate as a Traditional Naturopath and PhD in Natural Health. I studied mind-body medicine at the famed Benson-Henry Institute for Mind-Body Medicine at Harvard Medical School and pursued further education at The National Institutes of Health. I am a natural health practitioner with over two decades of experience and have an award-winning practice. Knowing that the more I learn, the more I can help others, I voraciously devour medical and health books and attend yearly continuing education courses. I have also served as an expert witness for multiple massage cases. </p>

<p>I have written scores of magazine articles about health and wellness, and lecture frequently on health and nutrition to audiences both lay and professional. I have appeared on dozens of radio show nationally and has been quoted as an expert in magazines and newspapers. I appeared on Lifetime Television and web TV shows educating about health and wellness, and my own TV show in development in Los Angeles. As a former actor with decades of theatre experience, I am at ease in front of groups and convey information in a fun and down to earth manner. My lectures are not only inspiring and education, but entertaining as well. </p>

<p>I have authored the book, The Alternative Medicine Cabinet which was selected as a finalist for the IndyExcellence Awards, produced an instructional massage DVD, Therapeutic Massage at Home; Learn to Rub People the RIGHT Way and is working on two books on mind-body medicine. </p>
