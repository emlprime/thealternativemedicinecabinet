<h1>What people are saying about Therapeutic Massage at Home:</h1>

<ul>
  <li class="testimonial"><p>The instruction was easy to understand and detailed without being monotonous; diction was clear, distinct and expressive; music was original and soothing; and the organization was good, I particularly liked the 'with' and 'without' instruction sections. I can't wait to get home and try it. </p> <p>~ Steven B, ND</p></li>
  <li class="testimonial"><p>I LOVE this DVD!</p> <p>~ Marla, Life Coach</p></li>
